            <section class="about" data-label="About me">
                <p>
                    Currently a permanent resident of the United States,
                    I've come a long way from Ukraine - my native country.
                    Yet being only 33 years old, I can speak English, Russian and Ukrainian.
                    I'm attached to photography, art in all forms, and I can go on about traveling,
                    discovering new cultures, traditions, mindsets, and amazing views of nature and architecture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Education-wise, I have a reputable Master's degree in Economics,
                    but my heart has always belonged to mathematics and sciences.
                    This desire carried me away into programming as the apogee of digital art.
                    What I enjoy about my work is that it is an opportunity to create something new and extraordinary.
                </p>

                            it was an excellent experience to take part in such kind of project and team.

                            Vladislav worked full time on "Demos" project from 2014 to 2017.
                            During these years he was the only front-end developer on the project.
                            He contributed to this work in a way that repeatedly surpassed expectations.
                            He has been a reliable, creative, diligent and good-humored team member,
                            with very good programming and problem-solving skills. In the team,
                            he has been a stable force, is on good terms and collaborates well with all team members,
                            and is one of the main contributors to a positive atmosphere.
                            He works well under pressure and has very useful abilities in finding new
                            and creative solutions. I have been fully satisfied with his work
                            and can recommend him whole-heartedly.

                            Vlad is a very creative developer with an ability to think outside the box.
                            Being a real perfectionist who is never satisfied with temporary or even good enough solutions,
                            he is very good at suggesting new ideas with a strong structured logical basis.
                            Having him in our team greatly benefited the project and there was always assurance
                            in the quality of his work. Also he is a true team player who is really fun to work with.

                            Vlad and I worked closely together at Cleerly as a design/developer combo. Not only does Vlad do pixel perfection work,
                            but he also has a keen eye for UI design. Vlad would usually be one of the first people I would ask to give feedback on
                            my designs. His thoughtful insight on how the UI should appear was at times the most valuable feedback I would get. His
                            development skills are top-notch. His skill sets are robust. I experienced Vlad working on extremely complicated
                            projects and knocking them out of the park. Not only would Vlad's feature development seam impressive, but he has the
                            sensibilities of a designer. I definitely recommend Vlad and would consider it a privilege to work with him again in the
                            future.
