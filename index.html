            <section class="about" data-label="About me">
                <p>
                    Currently a permanent resident of the United States,
                    I've come a long way from Ukraine - my native country.
                    Yet being only 30 years old, I can speak English, Russian and Ukrainian.
                    I'm attached to photography, art in all forms, and I can go on about traveling,
                    discovering new cultures, traditions, mindsets, and amazing views of nature and architecture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Education-wise, I have a reputable Master's degree in Economics,
                    but my heart has always belonged to mathematics and sciences.
                    This desire carried me away into programming as the apogee of digital art.
                    What I enjoy about my work is that it is an opportunity to create something new and extraordinary.
                </p>

                            Vlad is a very creative developer with an ability to think outside the box.
                            Being a real perfectionist who is never satisfied with temporary or even good enough solutions,
                            he is very good at suggesting new ideas with a strong structured logical basis.
                            Having him in our team greatly benefited the project and there was always assurance
                            in the quality of his work. Also he is a true team player who is really fun to work with.

                            Vladislav worked full time on "Demos" project from 2014 to 2017.
                            During these years he was the only front-end developer on the project.
                            He contributed to this work in a way that repeatedly surpassed expectations.
                            He has been a reliable, creative, diligent and good-humored team member,
                            with very good programming and problem-solving skills. In the team,
                            he has been a stable force, is on good terms and collaborates well with all team members,
                            and is one of the main contributors to a positive atmosphere.
                            He works well under pressure and has very useful abilities in finding new
                            and creative solutions. I have been fully satisfied with his work
                            and can recommend him whole-heartedly.
